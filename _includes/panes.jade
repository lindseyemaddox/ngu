            p John has been serving the risk management needs of local governments in some form or fashion since 1975. He founded NGU in 1999 after an accomplished 15-year career at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., where he held several leadership positions and was decorated with numerous achievement awards for producing and product innovation, including a banner year in 1997 when he was honored as the #1 producer in the entire nation. Maybe this success is why some of John’s competitors have cause for concern, we’re not sure. But his customers and employees sure seem to love and respect him and that’s what’s important to him. John is responsible for creating a culture at NGU where everybody loves to work here. They really do and it’s an uncommon thing to see.

            p John also has a history of serving in the public sector, having been elected as mayor of Clinton, Arkansas, at the age of 21, a position he held from 1975-1978, then as councilman for the City of North Little Rock from 1985-1989. John also ran for the Arkansas state legislature in 1990. This public service gives him the unique perspective that helps him understand the public sector and government entities unlike most.

            p “I want each of my clients and employees to get the absolute best there is to offer and know exactly what to expect,” says John. “I want them to feel comfortable in their relationship with me and this company and know that their decision to work with NGU is the best decision they have ever made. I want them to know that I am always here when they need help. I love to see someone walk into my office or life with a look of despair and see them leave with a smile on their face, motivated to tackle the world.”

            p Not shy about his beliefs in the proper role of government and personal responsibility, John uses his time, influence and resources to affect the political process at the local, state and federal level. He regularly supports candidates and causes that share his belief in limited government and individual liberties. When John is not working, he enjoys quiet time alone for introspection and self-evaluation, which he does in many ways like riding a lawnmower or working with any piece of machinery that doesn’t talk back to him. You might also find him sitting on a backhoe digging tree stumps or bush hogging on his farm, woodworking, rebuilding an engine for a friend’s car or welding together a boat dock that he designed and built from scratch. We know it’s weird that this kind of stuff is fun and relaxing to him, but it is.

            p John was born and raised in Clinton, Arkansas, where his father was a state trooper and his grandfather was a grass and cattle farmer. He gained a healthy respect for law and order from his father, but he spent most of his free time with his grandfather learning on the farm. John came to Tennessee in 1992 after the pool program he started for the state’s schools began to grow so much, he needed to be here to oversee its operations and growth. And he’s loved it here ever since.

            p Kyle started out at NGU back in 2000 working the phones while he was attending college and studying for IT certifications. He kept improving his knowledge and skills and eventually became the go-to tech geek for the company, which he has been doing now since 2003. Though he doesn&rsquo;t interface with our customers, he considers the employees of NGU, SEC, and TNRMT his clientele, a mindset that has served him well in his role.
            p &ldquo;I strive to make their job easier and more efficient while providing an up-to-date, secure, available, and stable IT infrastructure,&rdquo; says Kyle. &ldquo;I do my best to be proactive with maintenance to minimize downtime so they can work and serve our clients without interruption from any technical problem.&rdquo;
            p Of course, when you&rsquo;re the IT guy, you have to use your skills outside of the company and he often finds himself taking care of his extended family&rsquo;s computer and technology needs as well. He loves learning new technologies and is constantly adding to his geek power. And while he can&rsquo;t stand reality TV, he enjoys watching documentaries on the planet, universe, survival, and wildlife.
            p Kyle is always talking about his sons, Ethan, Eli, and his newest addition Kingston.  Kyle absolutely loves spending time with them. Together, they enjoy basketball, soccer, video games, Judo, and Wado-Ryu Karate. Kyle loves showing his sons the world around them. Kyle&rsquo;s hidden talents include his alleged exceptional cooking abilities. His family swears by his carrot cake, which they say is awesome. He also does a mean Cajun turkey for Thanksgiving that the holiday is lackluster without, so he has made two every year for nearly the last decade. And during the summer, Kyle is master of the grill, firing up some tasty burgers, steaks, and brats that are apparently all the rave by those who have had the pleasure. (Or at least that&rsquo;s what he tells us.)
